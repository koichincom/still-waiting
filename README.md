# Still Waiting - Discord Reminder Bot

A Discord bot that automatically monitors mentions and replies, then sends channel reminders if users don't respond within a specified time. Features smart monitoring, memory management, and comprehensive user tracking.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **[Invite Still Waiting to your server](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1379235275745656994&permissions=292057852928&integration_type=0&scope=bot)** *(Link will be added when deployed)*
2. Grant the required permissions during invitation
3. Start mentioning users or replying to messages
4. The bot automatically monitors and reminds users with channel mentions!

## ‚ú® Features

### Core Functionality

- **Automatic Monitoring**: Works without commands - simply mention users or reply to messages
- **Channel Reminders**: Sends reminder messages in the channel where mentions occur
- **User Mentions**: Monitors individual user mentions (`@username`)
- **Role Mentions**: Monitors all members when a role is mentioned (`@role`)
- **Reply Monitoring**: Monitors users when you reply to their messages (respects Discord's mention suppression)
- **Reaction Support**: Optionally accepts reactions as valid responses
- **Message Links**: All reminders include clickable links to the original message

### Advanced Features

- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of stale monitoring entries every 30 minutes
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents Discord API limits with intelligent message queuing
- **Concurrent Limits**: Configurable maximum concurrent monitoring (default: 1000)
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents multiple reminders for the same user/message combination
- **Smart Logging**: Comprehensive logging system for debugging and monitoring
- **Error Recovery**: Robust error handling with graceful fallbacks

## üîß How It Works

### User Mentions

```text
User: @john hey, can you check this?
Bot: [Starts monitoring john's activity]
[After wait time if no response]
Bot (Channel): @john, you did not respond to this message. Please reply!
```

### Role Mentions

```text
User: @developers please review this code
Bot: [Starts monitoring all members of the @developers role individually]
[Sends reminders to each member who doesn't respond]
```

### Reply Monitoring

```text
Original: "Has anyone seen the new update?"
Reply: "@john yes, it looks great!" (mentions john)
Bot: [Starts monitoring john for response to the reply]
[Sends reminder if john doesn't respond]
```

## üìã Required Permissions

When inviting the bot to your server, make sure it has these permissions:

- **Read Messages** - To see mentions and replies
- **Send Messages** - To send reminder messages in channels
- **Read Message History** - To check for responses and fetch original messages
- **Add Reactions** - For reaction response support (optional)

## üí° Example Usage

### Basic Mention with Reminder

```text
User: @sarah can you help with this bug?
Bot: [Starts monitoring sarah]
[After wait time if no response]
Bot (Channel): @sarah, you did not respond to this message. Please reply!
```

### Role Mention

```text
User: @moderators we need help in #general
Bot: [Starts monitoring all moderator role members individually]
[Sends reminders to each member who doesn't respond]
```

### Reply with Mention

```text
Original: "Has anyone seen the new update?"
Reply: "@john yes, it looks great!" (mentions john)
Bot: [Starts monitoring john for response to the reply]
[Sends reminder if john doesn't respond]
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Settings

The bot uses environment variables for configuration:

### Core Settings

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `DISCORD_TOKEN` | **Required** | Your Discord bot token |
| `WAIT_TIME` | `86400` | Time to wait before sending reminder (seconds, default: 24 hours) |
| `ALLOW_REACTIONS` | `true` | Accept reactions as valid responses |
| `ENABLE_NOTIFY` | `true` | Enable/disable all monitoring functionality |

### Performance Settings

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `MAX_CONCURRENT_MONITORING` | `1000` | Maximum number of simultaneous monitoring tasks |

### Example .env file

```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
WAIT_TIME=86400
ALLOW_REACTIONS=true
ENABLE_NOTIFY=true
MAX_CONCURRENT_MONITORING=1000
```

## ü§ñ Bot Behavior

### Smart Monitoring

- **Ignores bots**: Won't monitor or remind other bots
- **Ignores self-mentions**: Won't monitor users mentioning themselves  
- **Prevents duplicates**: Won't send multiple reminders for the same interaction
- **Respects mention suppression**: Only monitors replies that actually notify users
- **Memory management**: Automatically cleans up stale monitoring entries every 30 minutes

### Channel Reminder System

- **Channel reminders**: Uses @mentions in the original channel with message links
- **Graceful fallbacks**: Robust error handling for failed message delivery
- **Configurable**: All reminder behavior can be customized via environment variables

### Rate Limiting & Performance

- **API compliance**: Automatically rate limits messages to prevent Discord API limits
- **Concurrent limits**: Configurable maximum concurrent monitoring to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Resource cleanup**: Periodic cleanup prevents memory leaks from long-running instances
- **Error recovery**: Comprehensive error handling with detailed logging

### User Privacy

- **No data persistence**: All monitoring is in-memory only (no database)
- **Minimal logging**: Only logs essential information for debugging

## üÜò Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Bot not responding to mentions?**

- Verify the bot has "Read Messages" and "Read Message History" permissions
- Ensure the bot can see the channel where you're testing
- Check that the bot is online and properly invited to your server

**No reminder sent?**

- The user may have responded (message or reaction) before the wait time expired
- Check bot logs for any permission or API errors
- Verify monitoring is enabled (`ENABLE_NOTIFY=true`)

### Getting Help

If you encounter persistent issues:

1. Verify the bot has all required permissions in your server
2. Check the console logs for error messages
3. Ensure the bot is online and properly invited to your server
