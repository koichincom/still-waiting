## How It Works

### 1. Mention Someone

```
You: "@alice can you check this bug report?"
Bot: [Starts monitoring alice's activity]
```

### 2. Automatic Reminders

```
[After 24 hours if no response]
Bot: "@alice You haven't replied yet! We're STILL WAITING for your response!"
```

### 3. Smart Response Detection

- **Replies** to the original message remove the reminder
- **Reactions** to the message also count as responses
- **No spam** - only one reminder per person per message

---

## Features

- **Timestamps** - To determine when reminders should be sent

### Data Retention
- Data is automatically deleted when users respond to mentions
- Reminder data is removed after reminders are sent
- No message content, usernames, or other personal information is stored
